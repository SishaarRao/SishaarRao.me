Hello! My name is Sishaar Rao, and currently I’m a Senior at TJHSST! I’m a passionate Coder, with fluency in Python, JAVA, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with knowledge of PHP, Ruby on Rails, and Swift. I consider myself a huge fan of DIY culture, and love to invent and improve both products and services. This summer, I interned at RazorX2, an IT contractor based in Reston, Virginia. 

In my free time, I love to watch and create films of all genres and even languages. As the President of TJ.COMEDY, I lead our team in writing, editing, storyboard-ing, filming, and producing comedy sketches. I’m a Captain of the TJ Swing Dance Team, where we perform a dance style popular in the 30’s to 50’s at International Night, Talent Shows, and other venues. Finally, I’m an avid volunteer and enjoy working out, playing the guitar, and photography.
