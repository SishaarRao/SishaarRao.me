Hello! My name is Sishaar Rao, and I’m currently a Senior at TJHSST! I’m a passionate Coder, with fluency in Python, JAVA, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with knowledge in PHP, Ruby on Rails, and Swift. I’m a huge fan of DIY culture and love to invent and improve both products and services of every nature. This summer, I interned at RazorX2, an IT contractor based in Reston, Virginia. 

In my free time, I love to watch and create films of all genres and even all languages. As the President of TJ.COMEDY, I lead our team in writing, editing, storyboard-ing, filming, and producing comedy sketches. I’m a Captain of the TJ Swing Dance Team, a team where we perform a dance style popular in the 20’s to 50’s at International Night, Talent Shows, and other venues. Finally, I’m an ardent volunteer and enjoy working out, playing the guitar, and taking photographs.
