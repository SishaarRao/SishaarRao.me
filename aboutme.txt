Hello, my name is Sishaar Rao! I’m a passionate Coder, and a strong enthusiast of Ruby-on-Rails, Python, JAVA, and full-stack Web Development. I’m a huge fan of DIY culture and love to invent and improve both products and services of every nature. This summer, I interned at RazorX2, an IT contractor based in Reston, Virginia. 

In my free time, I love to watch and create films of all genres and even all languages. As the President of TJ.COMEDY, I lead our team in writing, editing, storyboard-ing, filming, and producing comedy sketches. I’m a Captain of the TJ Swing Dance Team, a team where we perform a dance style popular in the 20’s to 50’s at International Night, Talent Shows, and other venues. Finally, I’m an ardent volunteer and enjoy working out, playing the guitar, and taking photographs.
